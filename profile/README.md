<!-- ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION -->
## About The Organization

This Organization contains the logic behind the solution proposed to tackle the different problems encountered by AMYSME.
**AMYSME** is an enterprise that offers a full Smart House solution ( hardware and software ). Despite its sucess, it faces a lot of problems (systems, ressources ...)
that can lead to losing its value on the market. We can mention : 

  1- Its Spaghetti architecture and the entrangled communication between the departments.
  2- Its not fully digitalized (Use of papers).
  3- communication latency: R&D takes too much time to collect needed information due to the never growing quantity.
  4- Some dempartements are tightly coupled which reduce efficiency (Finance and production).
  5- The data is not standardized (bills format differ from provider to another, Finance only accepts excel...)
  6- Reports generations takes so long which affect the decision making process.
  7- Data duplication across departements.  

**The solution** is to create a new architecture where we can improve the overall performance of the enterprise with minimum damage across all departments, thus the
implementation of new services and a communication medium.
